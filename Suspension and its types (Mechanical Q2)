Suspension systems in vehicles are designed to perform  following main functions :
-Provide Comfort : Absorb Bumps and vibrations caused by it .
-Better Control : It keeps the wheel in contact with the road for better steering and providing better control over the vehicle .
-Durability : Reduces Wear and Tear on vehicle's parts.

Different types of Suspension -

#Independent Suspension:

Double Wishbone

MacPherson Strut

Multi-Link

#Dependent Suspension:

Solid Axle (Live Axle)

#Semi-Independent Suspension:

Torsion Beam

#Air Suspension

#Hydraulic Suspension

#Leaf Spring Suspension

%} MacPherson Strut Suspension

Structure:
The MacPherson strut suspension is a type of independent suspension system that combines a shock absorber and a coil spring into a single unit. The main components include:

Strut: A shock absorber is mounted inside a coil spring.

Lower Control Arm: Connects the wheel hub to the vehicle's chassis.

Steering Knuckle: Attaches to the strut and allows the wheel to pivot for steering.

Stabilizer Bar: Reduces body roll during cornering.

Practical Applications:
The MacPherson strut suspension is widely used in modern vehicles due to its simplicity, compact design, and cost-effectiveness. It is commonly found in:

Front-wheel-drive cars: The compact design allows for more engine space.

Compact and mid-sized sedans: Provides a good balance between comfort and handling.

SUVs and crossovers: Offers a good compromise between ride height and handling.

This type of suspension is favored for its relatively simple construction, which makes it easier and cheaper to manufacture and maintain.
